    Or maybe you just don't want them to know what you're doing.  Don't worry,  
    Dele-<i>gator</i> lets you fill out surveys for them!  
</p>

<p>
    Easily keep track of the talents you have on your team!  Simply fill out an Employee Survey for each team member 
    and Dele-<i>gator</i> will store the results.  When you have a project to delegate, fill in a Project Survey to 
    find out who the right employee for the job is!
